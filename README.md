# Unity
Unity's real-time 3D development platform enables artists, designers and developers to work together to create rich and interactive experiences. (Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.)
## Unity Engine
In the last few weeks we discovered the Unity Engine because my son would like to program his own games. Certainly a big project if you have little previous knowledge yourself. First of all, we should consider which project we want to start with. To get to know the [Unity Engine](https://goedden.info/unity-engine-erste-schritte/) a little bit, let's start with the traditional Hello World program.
## Unity Animation
How do we create characters in 2D with [Unity Animation](https://goedden.info/unity-animation-teil-1-character-in-2d/)? What is meant here is, for example, a character that we can control in a small jump & run game. Of course, we will not set up a whole jump & run game in this article, but we will only create a small character animation with the Unity Engine. We have divided this small topic alone into three posts.
